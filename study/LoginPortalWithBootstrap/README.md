Mobile responsive login page has been deployed using bootstrap framework. <br>
There is two way to import bootstrap in project. <br>
1- Use free open source CDN or <br>
2- Download css and js files to local and link local adreess.

For more information look at Bootstrap Documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

In this project, I have downloaded files and linked minified versions (bootstrap-grid.min.css, bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.bundle.min.js) in html.
