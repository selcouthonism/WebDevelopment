There is two way to import boostrapt in project.
1- Link CDN
2- Download css files to local and link local adreess.

For more information look at Boostrapt Documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

In this project, I have downloaded files and gave link of boostrapt-grid.min.css and boostrapt.min.css.
