There is two way to import boostrapt in project. <br>
1- Use free open source CDN or <br>
2- Download css and js files to local and link local adreess.

For more information look at Boostrapt Documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

In this project, I have downloaded files and linked minified versions (boostrapt-grid.min.css and boostrapt.min.css) in html.
