REST : Representational State Transfer
A web API that obeys the REST constraints is informally described as RESTful. 
RESTful web APIs are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.


-- HTTP methods --
GET:    Reading - Fetch - HTTP Request
POST:   Creating - Add something new
PUT:    Updating - Modify existing data
DELETE: Deleting - Delete existing data


Client  --- HTTP Request---->  Server
       <--- HTTP Response---  


HTTP Response -> Header + Body (JSON/XML)

HTML will be in the body.


server.js

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/path', function(request,response){
  //Request comes from client and response will be sent to client.
  response.send("Send response API");
});

app.post('/path', function(request,response){
  //Extract data from request body and insert to database.
});

app.put('/path', function(request,response){
  //Extract data from request body and update if it exist in database.
});

app.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log("Listen on port 3000");
});
